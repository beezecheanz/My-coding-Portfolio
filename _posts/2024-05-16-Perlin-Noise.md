# Perlin Noise

In class we looked into "random walkers", using Perlin noise and randomness to make things move around in an area.
In the session, we worked towards making interesting patterns and effects using these techniques. I mainly focused on using Perlin Noise over actual randomness as it is easier to make something look nice with noise. This is because randomness can be slightly overwhelming to a viewer and is harder to make like a creature wandering around and making decisions.

### Simple Random Walker
This was written in class, following along with a tutorial but changing things like variables and colours to my own preferences. This one makes a line of colurful dots slowly meander its way around the screen, leaving a faint trail behind it.

### Bee Flying
I then went away and decided to use this movement to make a scene of a bee flying around in some flowers as I thought that the way Perlin Noise makes an object move was often quite similar to how insects fly. I also used this as a way to practice functions, as I used them to create the flowers, instead of individually making each flower.
