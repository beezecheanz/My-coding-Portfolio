## Interaction

### First Tests
In class, we began a piece that would create a firework when the user clicked, which is one of the simplest forms of 
interaction a user can do. To push this idea further, a classmate and I added to this with randomising the 
colours and making it so that the colours slowly change over time.
I myself then added a few extra features, such as making the screen flash when the firework "explodes".

### Blob Game
In class, we also went further with this simple interaction of clicking the mouse, and made a simple game,
where there are blobs on screen that can be clicked on. I went away and added a a few features to make it more game like,
including a score that increases with each successful click.
I also added easing on the movement of the blobs, I learnt how to do that from a [website I found](https://cratecode.com/info/p5js-easing-functions).
If I had more time, I would add a 30 second timer, so that the user could attempt to get and beat high scores.

### Art Program
I thought that a good way of having interaction in a simple way is to have something like an art program, where there are 
different brushes and colours the user can use to make things on the page. It is a fairly simple set up but gives the user a
lot of freedom and ability to experiment. It also has the opportunity to be added to, such as interesting brushes or filters.
