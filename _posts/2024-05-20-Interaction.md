## Interaction

### Blob Game
In class, we also went further with this simple interaction of clicking the mouse, and made a simple game,
where there are blobs on screen that can be clicked on. I went away and added a a few features to make it more game like,
including a score that increases with each successful click and a timer so the player can attempt to get a high score.
I also added easing on the movement of the blobs as I thought that it made the game easier to follow and just looked nicer generally, I learnt how to do that from a [website I found](https://cratecode.com/info/p5js-easing-functions).
I added feedback when a blob is clicked by adding [a sound](https://freesound.org/people/fordps3/sounds/186669/) that plays after a successful click. I used [this sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/k1518155@students.katyisd.org/sketches/B1z411R3X) as an example to figure out how to implement it.

### Ink Blobs
We were introduced to [The Coding Train]((https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain), who makes video tutorials on different techniques that can be used in coding. I followed the [marbling algorithm tutorial](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/183-mathematical-marbling), that shows you how to make interesting marbled effects with "ink blobs" on a canvas. Thesse are the results I got from following the tutorial and looking at the code examples provided. I found the calculations kind of complicated so I basically [copied them line for line](https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/HtEtm1vii), however, for the actual creation of the blobs, I changed a few things while writing it. For example, I changed the colour palette to be a more muted one, as I thought it would look nice. I also changed the speed at which the blobs grow, as I thought it was more fun to play with when it goes faster.
